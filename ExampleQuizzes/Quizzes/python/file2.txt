'''The provided Python code implements the Bubble Sort algorithm,
 which sorts an array by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
The algorithm iterates through the array multiple times, with each pass pushing the largest unsorted element to its
correct position at the end. The code includes an optimization: if no swaps are made during a pass, the array is
already sorted, and the sorting process stops. The example initializes an array, applies the bubbleSort function to
sort it, and prints the sorted array. After sorting, the output is: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90], indicating ascending order.'''
